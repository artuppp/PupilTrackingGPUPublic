## üåü Introduction

Welcome to the **Pupil Tracking GPU** repository! This project is designed to leverage the power of modern GPUs for high-performance, real-time pupil tracking. Whether you're involved in eye-tracking research, developing advanced human-computer interaction (HCI) systems, or exploring applications in medical diagnostics, this repository offers a robust and adaptable foundation. Our goal is to provide a tool that is both powerful and accessible to the research community.

## ‚ú® Features

*   üöÄ **GPU Acceleration**: Utilizes CUDA for significant performance gains, enabling complex computations at high frame rates.
*   ‚è±Ô∏è **Real-Time Processing**: Achieves low-latency tracking suitable for interactive and time-sensitive applications.
*   üîß **Customizable Algorithms**: Implements multiple pupil detection algorithms (ELSE, EXCUSE, and their greedy variants) allowing users to choose based on their specific needs for accuracy and speed.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Flexible Platform**: Supports execution on both GPU and CPU for broader compatibility and testing.
*   üìä **Performance Measurement**: Integrated option to measure execution time for benchmarking and optimization.
*   üìñ **Open Source**: Developed for the academic and research community, encouraging contributions and collaborative improvement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to get the Pupil Tracking GPU software up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/artuppp/PupilTrackingGPU.git
    cd PupilTrackingGPU
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    This project relies on OpenCV.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
    ```

3.  **GPU Setup**:
    *   Ensure you have a CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU.
    *   Install the latest NVIDIA drivers for your GPU.
    *   Install the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) compatible with your drivers and project requirements.

4.  **Build the Project**:
    A `Makefile` is provided for easy compilation.
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    This will create the executable in the `build/` directory.

## üöÄ Usage

The main executable `pupil_tracking` can be run from the command line with several arguments to control its behavior.

**Synopsis**:
```bash
./build/pupil_tracking <image_path> <measure_time> <platform> <num_repetitions> <algorithm>
